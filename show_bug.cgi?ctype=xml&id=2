&gt; Bibletime UI (as all other modern UI) should be able to auto-detect the
&gt; system&apos;s language and, if the language is available, activate it automatically
&gt; (whitout the user needing to get the file from the website m-a-n-u-a-l-l-y! :(

As far as I know, BibleTime should auto-detect the language. Could you please comment a bit on how you currently manually change the language?

&gt; There should also be a place to manually change the UI language.

I guess we could implement such a feature right away, but if we do it now it would still need that BibleTime be restarted for the change to apply.

&gt; (really... how can such a great front end miss something so basic?! Not
&gt; everyone is a computer expert)

For more than a year we&apos;ve been working towards a solution which would make it able to change the language of BibleTime at runtime. In reality, this is a lot harder to implement than it might seem. But eventually, we&apos;ll be able to change the language of the application at runtime.</thetext>

&gt; As far as I know, BibleTime should auto-detect the language. Could you please
&gt; comment a bit on how you currently manually change the language?

Well, that&apos;s the thing... I don&apos;t change it! :( 
I just assumed that it could be changed, since you do have the language files available for download!

I&apos;m Portuguese and i&apos;ve even started the translation of BibleTime into Pt-Pt... however, since i didn&apos;t saw any way to change the language, i stopped. I thought that in the absense of the pt-pt language file, it would fall into pt-br or allow a user to select the prefered language!

But now, from what you&apos;re saying, i&apos;m starting to think that BibleTime works fine and, because it does not have a pt-pt, it does fall into english language... is that it?

if that&apos;s the problem, next week i&apos;ll get you a pt-pt UI file translated!


&gt; I guess we could implement such a feature right away, but if we do it now it
&gt; would still need that BibleTime be restarted for the change to apply.

I think everyone would be Ok whit that! Just an Alert saying that BibleTime would have to be restarted would work just fine! I thing having such an option (even if we have to restart BT to get the new language) makes total sense!!! e.g.: I&apos;m portuguese, there&apos;s no pt-pt language, but most portuguese users would understand much better pt-br that en.

e.g.2: I now a lot of people from other countries. They buy portables here in portugal - the Operating system cames in Portuguese, but those people could prefere to choose their own language which they understand better

More options = better software ;)

I guess that (very sadly) is a litle late to get it into 2.9 (since it&apos;s on RC2 already) but please, do add that option ASAP!

I&apos;ll get you that pt-pt file next week!</thetext>

Something like that, yes. I could try to make the fallback algorithm a bit more intelligent. I might even manage to get it into 2.9.0.


&gt; if that&apos;s the problem, next week i&apos;ll get you a pt-pt UI file translated!

You can take the pt_BR files as a basis. For br_BR translation file for versions 2.9 is located here:

  https://gitorious.org/bibletime/bibletime/blobs/stable-2.9/i18n/messages/bibletime_ui_pt_BR.ts

For older 2.8 versions its here:

  https://gitorious.org/bibletime/bibletime/blobs/stable-2.8/i18n/messages/bibletime_ui_pt_BR.ts

For the development branch:

  https://gitorious.org/bibletime/bibletime/blobs/master/i18n/messages/bibletime_ui_pt_BR.ts

&gt; &gt; I guess we could implement such a feature right away, but if we do it now it

Yes, its too late to get this feature into for 2.9.</thetext>

By the looks of it, there fallback algorithm provided by Qt appears to be rather good. The problem at hand is caused by the way we have named the translation files.

If QLocale::system().name() returns &quot;pt_PT&quot; for your system, then BibleTime will search (in order) for the following files in the translations directory:

  bibletime_ui_pt_PT.qm
  bibletime_ui_pt_PT
  bibletime_ui_pt.qm
  bibletime_ui_pt
  bibletime_ui.qm
  bibletime_ui
  bibletime.qm
  bibletime

The bibletime_ui_pt_BR.qm file just doesn&apos;t happen to be on that list. But the file can easily and should probably be renamed. I guess we have similar problems with other translations.</thetext>

As a native English speaker from Canada, I prefer en_GB spellings, so I do understand the subtle nuances between similar languages.

On the unix/linux side of things we could try a head fake and softlink files to emulate the behaviour we want.  I suspect we could do something similar with shortcuts on Windows. Not sure about the Mac stuff though.</thetext>

Hi,

yes there is an unification already ruling! However there will remain a few words (very few, indeed!) that will remain different. 
The major problem, however, is not those few words but the approach to the text chosen. To give you a simple and quick example (of many)in english (on the applications menu&apos;s) we find the &quot;File&quot; word. The problem is that in Portugal that word is directly translated from english and we get &quot;Ficheiro&quot;, but in Brazil they use &quot;Arquivo&quot; (&quot;archive&quot;, in english!) and no matter what you do, neither country will change this (even when we know that &quot;Arquivo&quot; and &quot;Ficheiro&quot; are two words that exist in both countries).

so, as you can see from the above example, there will have to be Pt and Pt_Br translations files for years to came :(




Now... other subject: i&apos;ve completed the BT translations into Pt-Pt!!! ;) where do i send it? can you give me an e-mail address or something like that?
