    <thetext>A &quot;duplicate tab&quot; option would come in really handy for those who use BT in tabbed mode. A tab represents a subwindow which can contain several open translations/commentaries - in some cases, in reality more representing a different session (compare BibleWorks) than just a tab. Depending on the amount of open modules, it can be quite time-consuming to open another identical such &quot;session&quot; (e.g. if you want to use the same modules to look at a different passage at the same time): You&apos;d have to open a module in a new window, then add the desired additional modules one by one. 

This is where it would be really nice to have a feature that essentially duplicates your current session - by duplicating a tab. 

Of course this feature would be even more powerful with my older request to have tabs within tabs=activities within BT: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2969483&amp;group_id=954&amp;atid=350954
In that request, jotik had commented that this was already implemented in some way in svn. I guess it didn&apos;t make it upstream so far. 

Thank you for all of your efforts with this program! 

(P.S.: I did not find a way to enter a feature request other than as a bug report. Hope this is alright.)</thetext>
